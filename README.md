#Ghost Chambers

More to come.

###Ghost Chambers is like a nice colourful mixture of good old-school elements:
The genre lands somewhere around Adventure RPG Shoot 'em up, and is inspired in all directions. 
The gameplay (and a couple of features) is probably best described with: DX-Ball with moving enemies of all kinds, 
upgradable weaponry, boss fights and a journey through a magical land to save the prin- haha, I'm joking with that last part. 

Don't worry, we've got something better up our sleeves!

The game features pixel art, but enlarged to allow "smooth" rotation and movement, 
original soundtracks created IN-HOUSE, nice overall old-school feel, easy to pick up and play, 
utilize the skill of bouncing bullets/grenades/other on walls to hit enemies exactly where you want to 
(There will be larger levels with walls and stuff), great and humorous storyline of course!
